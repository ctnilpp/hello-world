# hello-world
there is only one heroism in this world.to see the world as it is and to love it.I agree with it from now on.

all the time,we live,but we don't know what we live for?I always think about it in the night,but it takes up my lots of time.
In the dawn,from the pain,i gain a tip.the desiration is the truth of you.No one can live without relying on desire.
I am a poemer,i just write my desiration which express me.
